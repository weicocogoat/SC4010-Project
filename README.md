# NTU SC4010 Applied Cryptography Project - Simple Power Analysis
In this repository, we will be attempting to retrive RSA decryption keys from an Arduino running the RSA algorithm using Simple Power Analysis.
We will also be referencing a study done by Xunyue He, et al - Blind-Folded: Simple Power Analysis Attacks using Data with a Single Trace and no Training.
